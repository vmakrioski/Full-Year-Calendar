# Full-Year-Calendar
---
A simple full year calendar built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript library.

### Notes
---
The JavaScript library is added using the following script directly in the HTML:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/js-year-calendar@latest/dist/js-year-calendar.min.js"></script>
```

The calendar is created using the following JavaScript code:
```
new Calendar(document.querySelector('.calendar'));
```
Where '.calendar' is the selector of a 'div' element that should contain the created calendar.
